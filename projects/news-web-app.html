      <h2>News web app made with Node.JS</h2>
      <p>This web application was made for a User Interface programming course that was part of the EIT HCID master. The project consisted in creating a newspaper application for three different platforms: web, mobile and desktop. This project was made in collaboration with other two master students - Lukas Brückner and Vincent Giardina.</p>

      <p>The goal of this project is to develop a newspaper application with the typical
        functionalities needed to publish/manage a newspaper web page: show the news in its
        main page, show the details of a given news, filter the news according to their
        category, show the newspaper Twitter timeline, login to the application and be able to create,
        update or remove the news contents.</p>

      <p>The web application was developed using Node.JS. It was connecting to the API
        and retrieving the news from the server. The user is able to login through a simple
        authentication and, once logged in, he/she can create, update or delete articles.
        For the UI, it was used HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
