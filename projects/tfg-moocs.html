      <h2>My bachelor's thesis web application</h2>
      <p>The topic was to create a higher institutions ranking according to a KPI by measuring
        their amount of content online, more especifically the number of MOOCs. The process consisted in creating a web scrapper
        script in Python to download data from Coursera and Edx. Then, this data was cleaned and inserted
        into a MongoDB database. This information was then retrieved and displayed in a web application.</p>

      The topic was to create a university ranking according to their number of content online (MOOCs).">

      <p style="font-weight: bold;font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; margin-bottom:0; padding-bottom:0;">Architecture of the system</p>
      <p>The web application was developed following the model-view-controller architecture.
        The model will describe the database design and is the responsible for
        maintaining the data, which in this case is handled by MongoDB. The view presents the
        model in a way in which the user will be see and interact with the data in the User
        Interface (UI). It is handled by EJS and the controller. The controller will establish
        and control the interactions between the model and the view, which in this case will be
        handled in NodeJS and ExpressJS.</p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; margin-bottom:0; padding-bottom:0;">User Interface</p>
      <p>Regarding the User Interface used, everything is implemented using HTML 5,
        CSS version 4, EJS, Javascript and JQuery. For the homepage I used a technique
        called parallax scrolling in order to create a sense of dynamism and so that the
        website was not so static. </p>

      <p>In the data section, there will be tables displaying the top ranking universities.
        These tables are responsive and dynamic, so when changing the filter parameters,
        the table will get updated immediately. This filtering was performed by http requests to
        the server.</p>
      <p>Regarding the graphs section, this will display graphs, charts and maps from
        Highcharts using my own data. Highcharts is a pure JavaScript library used to
        enhance web applications by adding interactive charting capability. My web application
        focuses on linear graphs, bar graphs, pie charts and maps to display the different
        regions. By using Highcharts, there is also a section called “Comparison”, where
        the user will be able to compare two universities using charts views.</p>

      <p style="font-weight: bold;font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; margin-bottom:0; padding-bottom:0;">Deployment of web application</p>
      <p>Finally, the web application was deployed in Heroku. Heroku is a cloud platform
        as a service (PaaS) supporting Node.js that is used as a web application deployment
        model. The source code of my web application was deployed by using Heroku Git
        and pushing to master. Then, it was added a MongoDB to the resources of it.</p>
