      <h2>Sustainability coach</h2>
      <p>Project for a course in HCI project. It consisted of a process of making interviews, finding a need, creating personas and task scenarios, making a user journey map, a low fidelity prototype and finally program the prototype using Android Studio. Worked in collaboration with other UPM students: Lukas Bruckner, Vincent Giardina and Carlos Maya.</p>

      <img src="../images/sust.png" width="80%" style="margin: 50px 10%; margin-bottom: 30px;" alt="Sustainability Coach Mockup">

        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>All of us feel more and more concerned about the environmental crisis that we are facing. But it's kind of hard
         to understand and furthermore to implement sustainable habits when we are overcrowded by "eco to-dos".
         Here we wanted to inspire people in their daily lives and give relief to their actions by representing the
         impact through our sustainability coach. What that means is saving 15 liters of water while showering when
         eating a steak for the lunch requires 3000.</p>

         <h3>The Solution</h3>
         <p>The Sustainability Coach assists people in their daily lives for living a sustainable life.
         The main goal is to foster sustainable habits through the new system. It can adjust to the user’s
         preferences by asking about his priorities and goals. The user might be able to plan his “sustainability
         journey” according to his schedule and life situation. Based on this, the system suggests small habits.
         The user is constantly asked to provide feedback about these habits and give detailed information about if
         and how he did the tasks. </p>

         <h3>How did we reach this point?</h3>

         <p>We defined the context of use based on in-shop and street interviews. We targeted people who are aware and
           consumer responsibly. To meet them, our interviews took place in strategic places like a bio shop, a recycled
           clothing store and at the end of demonstration for the planet. We met around 40 people and after filtering
           through the people, we released 18 useful interviews. Plus, we realised 4 contextual inquiries to identify
           the most relevant profiles</p>

        <img src="../images/user-profiles.png" width="60%" style="margin: 50px 20%; margin-bottom: 30px;" alt="Identified user profiles">

        <p>We learned a lot from the habits of consumers in Madrid. Some results were very interesting,
          like the difference of understanding between people. In general, interviewees said that they felt
          very concerned by ecological issues and acts to be more sustainable. Almost all of them give themselves
          grades between 7 and 9 for their behaviour. In practice, the actions were much more contrasted. For some
          of them the only eco-friendly act that they perform is the recycling, while others are radically vegetarian.</p>

        <p>The most important barriers to be more sustainable are: the logistic, the cost, the time-consumption,
          and the lack of knowledge. Most common eco-friendly activities are: recycling and conscious consumption.
          Vegetarianism was rarely considered in the group of the Spanish people we interviewed. Therefore, a better
          consumption is considered: less or better meat, organic food, or local products.</p>

        <img src="../images/sust-journey.png" width="80%" style="margin: 50px 10%; margin-bottom: 30px;" alt="Journey Map">

        <p>From that user research, we had information to build two different prototypes: one for desktop
          and one for mobile. We designed a low-fi prototype for each of them and evaluated them.</p>

        <img src="../images/sust-desktop.png" width="80%" style="margin: 50px 10%; margin-bottom: 30px;" alt="Desktop low fidelity prototype">

        <img src="../images/sust-mobile1.png" width="30%" style="margin: 50px 5% 50px 15%; margin-bottom: 30px;" alt="Mobile1 low fidelity prototype">
        <img src="../images/sust-mobile2.png" width="30%" style="margin: 50px 10% 50px 5%; margin-bottom: 30px;" alt="Mobile2 low fidelity prototype">

        <p>Both prototypes were tested using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The user followed a task scenario
          while a facilitator helped him/her in the process. We always had an observer in the team following the behaviour
          of the tester. The experiment was followed by a questionnaire interview with the participants. Finally we asked
          him/her to fill-in a SUS questionnaire. From there, the mobile prototype was chosen and the mistakes found
          during the testing were improved in design.</p>

        <img src="../images/sust-high-fidelity.png" width="80%" style="margin: 50px 10%; margin-bottom: 30px;" alt="Mobile high fidelity prototype">

        <p>The high fidelity prototype was of course followed with some tests: interviews with tests, SUS questionnaire,
            and UEQ questionnaire (results above). Focussing on the 3 worst results of the EUQ, they make sense following
            the observations of the tester. Novelty: the app was not considered as "cutting-edge" and that's true we prioritised
            the standards over the experiment. Dependability: many users expected more features from the app. Perspicuity:
            users preferred intuitive UI rather than long texts which were used too often. </p>

        <h3>SUS Score: 82.50</h3>

        <p>Here, the app aimed to be efficient and effective because of the frame in which we worked on it. Therefore,
          I wish we had the room for more experiments and further designing. I believe that a the ecology is social.
          It would have been so much more interesting to have been able to test social interactions in the app. Even more,
          the ecology is not always fun, it could have been fun to explore the gamification or even a photo oriented application. </p>

        <p>Here you have the APK to test the app: <a target='_blank' style="color: #0096EA;" href='https://www.dropbox.com/s/iedxac5ndihz3ki/sustainability_coach.apk'>https://www.dropbox.com/s/iedxac5ndihz3ki/sustainability_coach.apk</a></p>
