      <h2>'Roll-a-ball' multiplayer videogame</h2>

      <p>'Roll-a-ball' is a game in which the player is identified as a ball and its main goal
        is to compete against other players to get the maximum amount of points by collecting
        objects. The objects are variable, can be cubes, spheres, gifts or any other 3D floating
        object to collect. There will be good objects which will increase your number of
        points and bad objects which will decrease your score. The game has a multiplayer
        interface with two to six players in each game. The game will also have several scenes
        to play, each one characterized by a theme. It will end once all the objects of the scene
        are collected or when the timer finishes. This game was developed with Unity and Java.</p>

      <p style="font-weight: bold;font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; margin-bottom:0; padding-bottom:0;">Client and Server architecture</p>
      <p>Clients will send a username and password to the server, which the server will authenticate
        by comparing to the data in the database. Once authenticated, users will receive a random
        unique ID that will be used to keep track of their session. When sending their coordinates,
        they will send their location and direction every 0.5 seconds. This may be able to be
        implemented into the “heartbeat” request so that if the server doesn’t receive coordinates
        for 10 seconds, then the client’s unique ID is released from any current games. </p>

      <p>The database keeps track of user data and the games that currently exist, but
        the actual game data like player coordinates, timer, etc., is stored in the RAM on
        the server. A new game can be a new thread. The server and the client will have
        their own protocol format instead of the standard HTTP. Requests will be sent using TCP.</p>

      <p style="font-weight: bold;font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; margin-bottom:0; padding-bottom:0;">UI of the game</p>
      <p>There are 8 different scenes for the user to play - a forest, an island with a beach,
        a city, winterland, candy world, lego world, racing-collect and Halloween.
        Each scene will have its own characteristics, for instance the pickupable objects and music, which
        will be changing according to the theme of the landscape.
        Some of these scenes will be locked at the beginning of the game, but when the user
        gains more experience and increase their level, the scenes will be unlocking.</p>

      <p style="font-weight: bold;font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; margin-bottom:0; padding-bottom:0;">Audio of the game</p>
      <p>Sound effects are going to help the player both immerse themself
        in the level and alert the player to the state of the level.
        The levels and ball are going to be made out of a variety of different materials.
        Our goal is to imitate the surfaces that the ball rolls on, the actions the ball
        takes, and the surfaces that the ball collides with. Sound effects are also going
        to be attributed to the various collectables in addition to milestone scores that
        occur as a result of playing through the level.</p>

      <p>Music is going to enhance the thematic elements of the level and lobby.
        Because each level/scene is going to have a unique artistic direction, the
        music is going to have to be composed in such as fashion.  The lobby, however,
        is going to provide the option to play a selection of different musical styles
        and, perhaps, music that plays in the levels.
