      <h2>Prototype for mobile app 'WakeApp'</h2>
      <p>Project for a course in User Experience and Mobile Prototyping. It consisted of a process of making interviews, finding a need, creating personas and task scenarios, making a storyboard and a user journey map. Finally, from that, we created moodboards and a prototype (using Justinmind) for a waking up mobile app. Worked in collaboration with other UPM students: Niels Dikken, Paula Manzano and Tobias Piffrader.</p>
