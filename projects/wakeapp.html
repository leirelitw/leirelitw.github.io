      <h2>UX/UI for mobile app 'WakeApp'</h2>
      <p>Project for a course in User Experience and Mobile Prototyping. It consisted of a process of making interviews, finding a need, creating personas and task scenarios, making a storyboard and a user journey map. Finally, from that, we created moodboards and a prototype (using Justinmind) for a waking up mobile app. Worked in collaboration with other UPM students: Niels Dikken, Paula Manzano and Tobias Piffrader.</p>

              <p class="boxtext">Goal is to define the user by creating “User Profiles”, then the task scenario and the environment around the user</p>

      <p>After doing an analysis of the interviews, we created an empathy map to understand better
        the user environment and to be able to identify the users profiles.</p>
      <img src="../images/empathy-map.png" width="60%" style="margin: 30px 20%" alt="Empathy map for WakeApp">

      <p>We identified two different kinds of user profiles, the disorganized user and the
        information consumer. The disorganized user just wants to keep sleeping and is always
        in a rush. They need to keep a tight schedule and receive continuous notifications in
        order to be on time.
          Contrarily, the information consumer is usually on time, so this user just needs to
          have a smooth wake up, comfortably checking up the phone notifications and the news.</p>

      <p>“Wakeapp” must fulfill the needs for both of these users. Therefore, the application will
        helps the users to wake up in a smooth or an energetic way. They will be able to create a
        schedule and receive notifications and gamifications to follow it. Users will also receive
        notifications about their subjects of interest (news, social media…) and will have a tab to
        explore and get the most relevant insights of their day.</p>

      <p>The next step was to create a user journey map in order to follow the steps the user will
        be doing with the mobile application. This metholodology ables to easily identify the pain
        points of the user and the moments of truth during the journey.</p>

      <p>The next step was to start the design of the prototype. Because of lack of time in the
        course, we skipped the layouts and low-fidelity prototype. Instead, with my team, we
        created 2 different loose moodboards with different designs to present to the client.</p>

      <img id="photo-ins" src="../images/mood-inspirational.png" alt="Loose moodboard version 2">

      <p>The client decided he preferred the first design. Therefore, the team created
        a refined moodboard according to the efficient, exciting and dynamic moodboard.
        In the refined version, it was defined the colour palette, the typography, different
        textures and patterns and some images to get some inspiration. </p>

      <img src="../images/mood3.png" width="80%" style="margin: 50px 10%; margin-bottom: 30px;" alt="Refined moodboard for WakeApp">

      <p>The last step was to start designing and building the high-fidelity prototype using
        “JustinMind” tool. One of the main decisisions was to make the app with the “dark”
        mode since the users will mostly use it when they wake up in the morning and having a
        darker screen for the eyes is more pleasant.</p>

      <p>The app will be following the iOS guidelines by using iOS status bar, the use of
        Apple System Icons, Apple text fields and keyboards. It will also be using the iOS
        date pickers, toggles and the sliding right to go back. The buttons will have rounded
        corners as well as the little cards for the tasks of the days. Everything is meant to
        be kept very simple and smooth for the users.</p>

      <p>The final result is displayed in the following image.</p>

      <img src="../images/wakeapp2.png" width="80%" style="margin: 30px 10%" alt="WakeApp">

      <p>For the user testing there were two tasks scenarios created to put into conext
        to the users. Then, each type of user will have a different task to perform within
        the application.</p>

      <h3>Disorganized User</h3>

      <p style="font-weight: bold;font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; margin-bottom:0; padding-bottom:0;">Task Scenario</p>
      <p style="padding-top:0; margin-top:10px">“Tobi is a mess when it comes to organizing his day. One of the main reasons is that
        he always gets up late. Tomorrow he does not want to mess it up, because his crush Sara
        wants to have breakfast with him. That is why he sets up his morning schedule with the
        WakeApp. He opens the app and clicks the “Add events” button of the chosen day. On a new
        screen, he will be able to modify the tasks of last week, add events or just start from
        scratch.”</p>

      <p style="font-weight: bold;font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; margin-bottom:0; padding-bottom:0;">First task to perform</p>
      <p style="padding-top:0; margin-top:10px">You noticed today that you should have woken up a bit earlier. That’s why you
        should go to the schedule of Tuesday (today) and change the first event instead
        of waking up at 7:00am. You want to wake up at 6:30am (30 mins duration)</p>

      <p style="font-weight: bold;font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; margin-bottom:0; padding-bottom:0;">Second task to perform</p>
      <p style="padding-top:0; margin-top:10px">Create a schedule for Wednesday with the following actions:
        Event 1: Wake up at 8:30am (15 mins duration)
        Event 2: Have breakfast at 8:45am (15 mins duration)
        Event 3: Finish prototype at 9:00am (3 hours duration)</p>

        <h3>Information Consumer</h3>

        <p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; margin-bottom:0; padding-bottom:0;">Task Scenario</p>
        <p style="padding-top:0; margin-top:10px">“María likes to keep herself up-to-date with the daily news. When she wakes up,
          she doesn't like to be in a rush. She prefers staying in bed longer to check social
          media or even watch a TED talk. Additionally she enjoys reading the news while having
          a calm breakfast. She is also a big fan of apps that show her recommendations based
          on her behavior.”</p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; margin-bottom:0; padding-bottom:0;">First task to perform</p>
        <p style="padding-top:0; margin-top:10px">Check the current user preferences and deactivate Twitter and Youtube.</p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; margin-bottom:0; padding-bottom:0;">Second task to perform</p>
        <p style="padding-top:0; margin-top:10px">Explore the entertainment section. Click through the publications that you
          find interesting and let the App know if you liked the content or not.</p>
