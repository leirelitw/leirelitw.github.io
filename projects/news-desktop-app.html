      <h2>News desktop app made with JavaFX</h2>
      <p>This desktop application was made for a User Interface programming course that was part
        of the EIT HCID master. The project consisted in creating a newspaper application for three
        different platforms: web, mobile and desktop. This project was made in collaboration with
        other two master students - Lukas Brückner and Vincent Giardina.</p>

      made with Node.JS. Worked in collaboration with Lukas Brückner and Vincent Giardina." >

      <p>The goal of this project is to develop a newspaper application with the typical
        functionalities needed to publish/manage a newspaper web page: show the news in its
        main page, show the details of a given news, filter the news according to their
        category, show the newspaper Twitter timeline, login to the application and be able to create,
        update or remove the news contents.</p>

      <p>The desktop application was developed using JavaFX. It was connecting to the API through
        the API endpoints and was retrieving all the information. The main screen was an accordion
        list from JavaFX displaying all the news according to the category selected on the left sidebar.
        The user is able to login and interact (either update or delete) with the news he/she already
        created or create a new article.</p>
