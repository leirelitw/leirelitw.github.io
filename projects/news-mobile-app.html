      <h2>News mobile app made with Android Studio</h2>
      <p>This mobile application was made for a User Interface programming course that was part of the EIT HCID master. The project consisted in creating a newspaper application for three different platforms: web, mobile and desktop. This project was made in collaboration with other two master students - Lukas Brückner and Vincent Giardina.</p>

      <p>The goal of this project is to develop a newspaper application with the typical
        functionalities needed to publish/manage a newspaper web page: show the news in its
        main page, show the details of a given news, filter the news according to their
        category, show the newspaper Twitter timeline, login to the application and be able to create,
        update or remove the news contents.</p>

      <p>The mobile application was developed using Android Studio. It was connecting to the
        API through the endpoints and was retrieving all the information and inserting it into cards.
        The main screen was displaying cards with an image, the title of the news and its abstract.
        Once the user clicked in one of the cards, a new activity is opening with the full
        information of the news. This was implemented by retrieving the ID of the clicked card and
        in the new screen was retrieving all the information from the ID selected.</p>
